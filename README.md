# Python Algorithms

## Description
This directory contains Python programs solving various algorithm problems. The problems come from various sources such as CodeWars, Hackerrank, online courses, books, etc.

### squared\_string.py
You are given a string of n lines, each substring being n characters long. Write these functions diag\_1\_sym, rot\_90\_clock, selfie\_and\_diag1, and high-order function oper(fct, s).
Examples:
s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop"
oper(diag\_1\_sym, s) => "aeim\nbfjn\ncgko\ndhlp"
oper(rot\_90\_clock, s) => "miea\nnjfb\nokgc\nplhd"
oper(selfie\_and\_diag1, s) => "abcd|aeim\nefgh|bfjn\nijkl|cgko\nmnop|dhlp"
